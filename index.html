    <p><strong>Bio:</strong> My name is Gerald Lynch and I was born February 20th, 2003 in Brooklyn New York.
        I attend NEST+M and I am a rising senior looking to expand my knowledge. I have 3 older sisters 
        and I am the only boy in the family. I enjoy going outside with my friends, playing sports, and 
        playing chess. I am new to computer science and I wish to learn as much as I can about it. I plan
        to major in computer science and All Star Code will be the stepping stone into the world of tech.
